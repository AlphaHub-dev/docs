# Introduction

AlphaHub is a zero-code platform that allows anyone to design customized machine learning models.

There are two USPs:
* First is providing assistance during model development based on the userâ€™s skill-set and the shared problem statement.
* Second is the [interface](/getting-started/understanding-interface) which removes all the code and still adds sophisticated functionalities that are not available with competitors.

Combining these enables the user to learn and develop models in less time, and deploy and iterate quickly.
