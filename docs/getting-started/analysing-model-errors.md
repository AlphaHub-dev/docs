# Analysing model errors

While you design a model, you will encounter several errors. We have developed a smart service that analyses all possible problems with your model and provides you with the solution. Below are some examples.

Clicking on the ‘Save draft’ button will save the current state of your model and analyse it for any problems and respond with a solution in real-time. You will find the error and the fix by hovering over the `Validation Errors` info next to the **Save draft** button. You can fix the model with the provided recommendation and when everything is perfect, the system will respond with `Your model looks good`.
