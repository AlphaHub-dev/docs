# Adding layers to model
As you start building your model, you need to add more layers to the model in the canvas. Below are the instructions to add layers to the model.

`We are introducing blocks and pre-trained models in our next release. You can add them to your model the same as the layers.
Instructions`

There are two ways to add layers to the model:

  *  Find layers in the left panel using the search and drag it on the canvas.

  *  Click on the settings icon on the recently added layer, this will open the parameters panel from the right. Then use our recommendation engine and click on **Add to model**. This will add the layer on the canvas.

 

`Adding layers on the canvas is the first step, you have to connect all the layers yourself. We are working on our engine to show suggested connections on the canvas.`
